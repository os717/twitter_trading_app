# twitter_trading_app

Hi , thanks for stopping by!

This is an application we built at a fin-tech hackathon we attended at Macquarie back in April - where we came second (yayy!!) 

The app scans Twitter and analyses word segments across the platform to predict stock market changes in selected S&P500 companies.

This is only an MVP so there may stil be a few small bugs, etc (which is amazing conisdering this was literally built on caffeine alone :p) 

### A special thank you to https://github.com/ibzmo the other major code contributor to this app: Check out his github!!

`pip install python-dev`
