# twitter_trading_app

This is an application we built in a team of 4 for a hackathon I attended at Macquaire back in April. WE CAME SECOND :) (YAYYYYY!!!!)

The app scans Twitter and analyses word segments across the platform to predict stock market changes in selected S&P500 companies.

# How to use:

`pip install python-dev`

`virtualenv venv`

`git clone https://github.com/os717/twitter_tradding_app.git`

`cd twitter_trading_app`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`wget http://thinknook.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Sentiment-Analysis-Dataset.zipl`
